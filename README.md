# CIFAR-10 Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that classifies images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras, and it demonstrates a standard approach for building and training a CNN for image classification tasks.

## Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset is a collection of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The 10 classes are:

- Airplane
- Automobile
- Bird
- Cat
- Deer
- Dog
- Frog
- Horse
- Ship
- Truck
